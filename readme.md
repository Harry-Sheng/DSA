## Introduction to Algorithm Design (ADM chapter 1)

- Reasonable-looking algorithms can be easily be incorrect. Algorithms correctness must be proven.
- Proving correctness of algorithms need clear and precise modelling of the problem. We need the set of allowed input instances and the required properties of the algorithm's output.
- An important technique in algorithm design is to narrow the set of allowable instances until there is a correct and efficient algorithm.
- The heart of any algorithm is an idea. If your idea is not clearly revealed when you express an algorithm, then you are using too low-level a notation to describe it.
- Searching for counterexamples is the best way to disprove the correctness of a heuristic.
- Modeling your application in terms of well-defined structures and algorithms is the most important single step towards a solution.
